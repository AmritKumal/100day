Sample post Day 1 : 



#Day1ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra100days
Good day, everyone. I'm Anisha Dhakal, and I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 100-days challenge. During this time, I'm learning web development. I had previously learned HTML and was learning CSS, but I was unable to complete it due to some reason, so I'd like to continue. And this time, with the help of a small handful of inspiring team members from askmitra.com and Team, I'm confident I'll succeed. I encourage everyone to begin their 100 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. 

I’m excited already. learn more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Here's what I learned today.
- basic syntax
- ways to implement CSS
- selectors
- comments, 
- colors
- Backgrounds

Summary: Syntax is pretty simple consisting of selector and declaration block, declaration block is further divided as property and value like I have to select p tag and colour it red I have to p {color : red;}, We can implement CSS in three ways Inline, in the header (Internally) and also external file can be linked (this is the preferred way) ….


I've also included links to some of the resources I used if anybody interested can follow along.
